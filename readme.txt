I created this YouTube Website Clone using HTML and CSS as my task for the Frontend role in the WebTeam 2022.

This is the replica of the current YouTube layout, I decided to go with the current layout as it is more complex and does not have dozen of tutorials dedicated as to how to recreate it so I could put my own twist to the task and the recreation.

This layout was designed on a 1920 x 1080 resolution but some changes were made to the code to make sure the structure of the code remains the same in any resolution, to get the full view of the website I would recommend reducing the zoom of the browser.
